- 👀 I’m interested in software Engineering, Music, Singing, Guitar and videography.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS, Tailwind, Next JS and React Native.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before coding, I traveled the world as a professional musician, performing on cruise ships and stages in the Middle East. I've also built 5 trading indicators and an algorithm in MQL4. When I’m not coding or strumming my guitar, you’ll likely find me surfing or creating cool videos!
